# Lost and Stolen Profiles

## Lockdown

Locks down the phone after receiving SMS with word 'Lockdown**' (replace ** or whole word with your unique code-word). Invoques 'AppsGoHome' profile (see below). Discretely sends back the GPS location every 10 minutes. (Obviously the phone needs to be on and have signal for the lockdown to work).

## AppsGoHome

Activates the 'Tasker App Action -> Kill App' on all selected apps. The apps can be selected on Tasker easily.
