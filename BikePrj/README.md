# Bike Riding Profiles

Profiles for task automation when riding the motorcycle.

## Riding On

Triggers the *RidingVarOn* task (the task simply toggles the variable %RIDING on). This task (*RidingVarOn*) can also be activated with an toggle button icon on the phone or reading a NFC tag sticker on the bike (with the task *MotoRide*).

### MotoRide task

Turns BT on and WiFi off, and sets variable %RIDING to *on* (or opposite). Gives feedback with a screen message confirmation and an audible beep (that normaly can be hear with helmet on and the engine running).

## Riding Settings

The phone settings and list of profiles to turn *on* or *off* according to the %RIDING variable status:
* Phone volume setting.
* Phone screen brightness (and timeout).
* Profile for incoming calls (say caller name or number).
* Profile to read incomming SMS.
* Profile for calls unanswered from selected contacts.
* Profile to read messages from messaging apps.
