# Tasker Stuff

Collection of task and profiles for Tasker (Android authomation app) I use.
Some I've done myself (most of the simple/easy ones), some I've adopted and adapted from others (most of the complex ones.
XML files to import directly (check before, some files may have bits to fill or change). TXT files contain the profile/task descriptions (to follow and enter manually on the app).

## Projects

### General Assistance - GenAssistPrj

Some basic profiles to set/activate on the phones of the aging parents.
* To find the phone if misplaced, turn Wifi on authomatically at home, locate in case of emergency, have someone reminding to charge the phone if battery low, and ramp up the volume if caller persistent.

## Profiles

Stand alone profiles and tasks (not grouped under a particular project tab).
