# Tasker Stuff

Collection of task and profiles for Tasker (Android automation app) I use.
Some I've done myself (most of the simple/easy ones), some I've adopted and adapted from others (most of the complex ones.
XML files to import directly (check before, some files may have bits to fill or change). TXT files contain the profile/task descriptions (to follow and enter manually on the app).

## Projects

### General Assistance - GenAssistPrj

Some basic profiles to set/activate on the phones of the aging parents.
* To find the phone if misplaced, turn Wifi on authomatically at home, locate in case of emergency, have someone reminding to charge the phone if battery low, and ramp up the volume if caller persistent.
* See README.md file for details.

### Lost or Stolen - LostStolenPrj

Simple profiles in case of an unfortunate lost or stolen scenario.

## Profiles

Stand alone profiles and tasks (not grouped under a particular project tab).

### Battery Full Alert - Batt_Full

The phone lets you know when it reaches full charge, unless it happens while sleeping (sleeping time set between 11:15pm and 6:45am.

### Full Charge Count - Charge_Count

As batteries are no longer removable, and having the last mobiles failing to retain the charge with time; decided to get a simple charge counter on my current phone to have an idea of how many charge cycles does it really do before failing. (Note: I do know there are other important factors that determine the life of a Li-ion, this is just to have me a comparative idea).

### Phone Balance Query - Phone_Balance

When using a prepaid/PAYG SIM card, and after hanging a call, it send the balance query hash code authomatically to the mobile service provider. (Note: set the corresponding hash code of your mobile plan).

### USB Power Source Type - PwrSrcID1 and PwrSrcID2

Simple flash screen showing if the cable connected is power only 'AC' or power and data 'USB'. (Lost quite some time in the past figuring out why the phone was not connecting with the computer, or where did the data cable broke, just to find I got the wrong cable).

### Quiet Night

Turns down the notifications volume between 11:15pm and 6:45am next day.
